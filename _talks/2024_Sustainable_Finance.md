<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">I talked about our latest paper on carbon pricing, in which we investigated whether carbon taxes with and without carbon
dividends improve cooperative behavior to mitigate
simulated climate change. We implemented a randomized controlled trial on a large sample of the U.S. general
population (N = 2,116). Played in real-time in groups of four, we tested three carbon-pricing treatments and a
baseline condition within a modified threshold public goods game of loss avoidance. %We investigate whether a carbon tax
alone, a carbon tax with carbon dividends paid out in equal share (symmetric dividend), and a carbon tax with carbon
dividends paid out to below-average polluters only (asymmetric dividend), reduces carbon-emitting group consumption. We
measure the portion of groups who successfully remain below a critical consumption (emission) threshold.
We found that a carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends reduces carbon-emitting group consumption relative to a
baseline condition with no tax, and relative to a carbon tax only. A carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends paid out
to below-average polluters (asymmetric dividend) worked best, with 94% of groups remaining below a critical
consumption (emission) threshold. We also found that experiencing the asymmetric dividend condition positively affected
perceptions of carbon pricing with carbon dividends.</div>
