<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Collective action problems emerge when individual incentives and group interests are misaligned, as in the case of
climate change1–5. Individuals facing collective action problems are often considered to have two options: contribute
towards a public solution or free-ride. But they might also choose a third option of investing in a private solution
such as local climate change adaptation6–8. Experimental research on the dynamics of collective action problems
featuring private solutions has been conducted only in single-country contexts, thereby lacking generalisability. Here
we introduce an experimental collective action problem featuring wealth inequality, public and private solutions, and
participants from 34 countries. In this presentation, I talked about results from a hierarchical clustering analysis on
relevant variables in our dataset.</div>
