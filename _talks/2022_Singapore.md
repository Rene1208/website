<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In this conference presentation I talked about a PhD project together with my former colleague Laura Hueber, PhD,
titled: "Do MTurkers Exhibit Myopic Loss Aversion?", in which we present results from a highly powered online
experiment with 937 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) that examined whether MTurkers exhibit myopic loss
aversion (MLA). The experiment consisted of measuring MLA-compliant behavior in two between-subjects treatments that
differed only regarding the risk profile of the risky asset employed. We found no statistically significant evidence of
MLA-compliant behavior for any of the two risk profiles among MTurkers in the full samples. However, we found evidence
of MLA for one of the two risk profiles in some sub-samples where we screened-out participants based on processing times
in the experiment.</div>
