<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In this conference presentation I talked about a PhD project together with my former colleague Laura Hueber, PhD,
titled: "Debiasing Through Experience Sampling: The Case of Myopic Loss Aversion", in which we introduce a training intervention based on a novel tool
to mitigate behavior consistent with myopic loss aversion (MLA). We present the results of a large-scale online
experiment with 894 student participants. The study featured a two-step debiasing training intervention based on
experience sampling and a subsequent elicitation of MLA. We found that participants in the baseline treatment exhibit
behavior consistent with MLA, which was not the case for decision makers who underwent the debiasing training
intervention. Nonetheless, we found no statistically significant difference-in-difference effect of the training
intervention on the magnitude of MLA. However, when we focused on the more attentive participants, the magnitude of the
difference-in-difference effect of the training intervention increased strongly and became statistically significant
when controlling for age, gender, education, field of study, investment experience, and risk preferences.</div>
