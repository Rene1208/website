Abstract: Exposure to nature is positively associated with pro-environmental behavior, though causal evidence to date is
limited. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with N=542 participants, to explore whether a one-time encounter
with nature can lead individuals to behave more pro-environmentally. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four
conditions, spending 15 minutes either walking through a park, walking through an urban area, viewing a video of a
nature walk, or taking a break while seated at a desk. Participants received a EUR 10 endowment to either keep for
themselves or donate to a conservation, social, or cultural charity. We observed pro-environmental behavior by measuring
donations to the conservation charity, which came at a direct cost to participants. We found modest support that real
exposure to nature positively affects pro-environmental behavior, as evidenced by higher average donations compared to
watching a nature video, but not compared to any other condition. Self-reported restoration mediated the effect, but
lost significance when controlling for environmental concern. Thus, attention restoration as a mechanism was driven by
environmentally concerned individuals. Fostering more nature experiences may present a relevant avenue for
behavior-change. We discuss limitations and propose several directions for future research.
