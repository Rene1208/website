Abstract: Does market interaction influence morality? We study a particular angle of this classic question theoret-
ically and experimentally. The novelty of our approach is to posit that people are motivated by reciprocity â€“ an urge
many argue affects humans. While many have suggested that market interactions make people more selfish, our
reciprocity-based theory allows that market interaction on the contrary induces more prosociality. Our experiment
provides a test of the empirical relevance of such an effect, in some highly stylized settings. The results are
broadly (but not completely) supportive. They may shed light on the development of morality and prosocial behavior over
time, with respect to episodes in history where the nature of commerce was transformed.
