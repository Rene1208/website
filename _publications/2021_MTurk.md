Abstract: We present results from a highly powered online experiment with 937 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) that
examined whether MTurkers exhibit myopic loss aversion (MLA). The experiment consisted of measuring MLA-compliant
behavior in two between-subjects treatments that differed only regarding the risk profile of the risky asset employed.
We found no statistically significant evidence of MLA-compliant behavior for any of the two risk profiles among MTurkers
in the full samples. However, we found evidence of MLA for one of the two risk profiles in some sub-samples where we
screened-out participants based on processing times in the experiment.
