Abstract: We investigated whether carbon taxes with and without carbon dividends improve
cooperative behavior to mitigate simulated climate change. We implemented a randomized
controlled trial on a large sample of the U.S. general population (N = 2,116). Played in
real-time in groups of four, we tested three carbon-pricing treatments and a baseline
condition within a modified threshold public goods game of loss avoidance. We found that
a carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends reduces carbon-emitting group consumption
relative to a baseline condition with no tax, and relative to a carbon tax only. A carbon
tax coupled with carbon dividends paid out to below-average polluters (asymmetric
dividend) worked best, with 94% of groups remaining below a critical consumption
(emission) threshold. We also found that experiencing the asymmetric dividend condition
positively affected perceptions of carbon pricing with carbon dividends.
