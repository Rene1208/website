Abstract: We conducted two large-scale, highly powered randomized controlled trials intended to
encourage consumer debt repayments. In Study 1, we implemented five treatments vary-
ing the design of envelopes sent to debtors. We did not find any treatment effects on re-
sponse and repayment rates compared to the control condition. In Study 2, we varied the
letters’ contents in nine treatments, implementing factorial combinations of social norm
and (non-)deterrence nudges, which were either framed emotively or non-emotively. We
find that all nudges are ineffective compared to the control condition and even tend to
induce backfiring effects compared to the agency’s original letter. The results of this study
contrast with the findings of other studies, which indicate that comparable nudges are
highly effective. Thus, our results are more consistent with the literature suggesting that
the success of nudging interventions is limited to certain conditions.
