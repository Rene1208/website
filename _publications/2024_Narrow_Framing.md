Abstract: Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk-taking. This is
known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion
indicating that MLA's applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we
reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We
systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters (1997) to include five key adjustments. These
involved down-scaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results—which are highly robust
to analytical heterogeneity—consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.
