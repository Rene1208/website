Abstract: We investigate determinants of price expectations and satisfaction levels of financial pro-
fessionals and students. In experiments with 150 professionals and 576 students, we sys-
tematically vary price paths according to the final return (positive or negative) and the
way in which the final return is achieved (upswing followed by downswing or vice versa).
Professionals show the most optimistic price expectations and are most satisfied if as-
sets fall in price first and then recover. In addition, professionals’ price expectations are
highest after positive returns. Among students, qualitatively similar patterns emerge, but
professionals’ price expectations are less prone to framing effects.
