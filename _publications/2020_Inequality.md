Abstract: In this paper we investigate the generalizability of the role of unequal opportunities and social group
membership in redistributive preferences and examine the interaction between these two dimensions. We present results
from a large-scale online experiment with more than 4,000 participants from Germany. The experiment consists of a
real-effort task and a subsequent dictator game with native Germans and immigrants to Germany. We find that dictator
transfers to the own group by native Germans and immigrants are higher under unequal opportunities than under equal
opportunities. While we confirm the main findings reported in previous literature regarding the role of inequality of
opportunity in redistribution for native Germans and immigrants, we find distinctively different patterns between both
groups concerning the influence of social group membership and its interaction with unequal opportunities on
redistribution. In particular, contrary to natives, immigrant dictators transfer more to in-group than to out-group
receivers under unequal opportunities and do not compensate for unequal opportunities of out-group members. We conclude
that in order to increase the understanding of patterns reported in the literature, it is crucial to also investigate
the generalizability of findings to individuals from the general population and to explicitly cover participants such as
immigrants who represent important parts of our society.
