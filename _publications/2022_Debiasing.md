Abstract: We introduce a training intervention based on a novel tool to mitigate behavior consis-
tent with myopic loss aversion (MLA). We present the results of a large-scale online ex-
periment with 894 student participants. The study featured a two-step debiasing training
intervention based on experience sampling and a subsequent elicitation of MLA. We found
that participants in the baseline treatment exhibit behavior consistent with MLA, which
was not the case for decision makers who underwent the debiasing training interven-
tion. Nonetheless, we found no statistically significant difference-in-difference effect of the
training intervention on the magnitude of MLA. However, when we focused on the more
attentive participants, the magnitude of the difference-in-difference effect of the training
intervention increased strongly and became statistically significant when controlling for
age, gender, education, field of study, investment experience, and risk preferences.
