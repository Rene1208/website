Abstract: We implemented a decision market on 41 systematically selected MTurk social science experiments published in
PNAS between 2015 and 2018. Social scientists (n = 162) traded on the outcome of direct replications, knowing that the
12 studies with the lowest and the 12 with the highest final market prices would be selected for replication, along with
two randomly selected studies. The replication rate was 83% for the top-12 and 33% for the bottom-12 group. The
correlation between decision market prices and replication outcomes was 0.505, indicating some potential for decision
markets to select studies for replication. Overall, 54% of the studies were successfully replicated, with replication
effect sizes averaging 45% of the original effect sizes. These results suggest that the replicability of MTurk
experiments is comparable to that of previous systematic replication projects involving laboratory experiments. All
study aspects were preregistered, and we strictly adhered to our pre-analysis plan.
